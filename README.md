# Pastel Grid Builder App

## Introduction
This application allows users to create a dynamic grid with draggable square cells, customize grid size, adjust spacing between cells, and change the grid's background color.


## Features
- **Customizable Grid Size**: Users can set the grid dimensions (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.).
- **Adjustable Cell Spacing**: Users can modify the spacing between grid cells.
- **Grid Color Selection**: Users can change the background color of the grid cells.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Cells can be moved within the grid.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **React Native**: The primary framework for building the mobile application.
- **@mgcrea/react-native-dnd**: Used to implement the drag-and-drop functionality for grid cells.

## Design Decisions
- **Separation of Logic and UI**: Create a useGrid hook to handle the logic

## Challenges Faced
1. **Searching for and selecting a library to implement the drag-and-drop functionality**:
   - Finding a suitable library that supports drag-and-drop interactions in React Native while maintaining performance and flexibility.
   - Solution: Evaluated multiple libraries and selected @mgcrea/react-native-dnd due to its ease of integration and compatibility with the project.
